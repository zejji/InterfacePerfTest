# InterfacePerfTest

This repo contains the source code for a C#/.NET 6 console application using BenchmarkDotNet which is intended compare the performance of explicit interface implementation methods vs concrete class method calls.

## Getting started

- `dotnet build -c Release`
- `dotnet run -c Release`

The console application will print instructions and prompt for benchmark configuration details.
